# Update: I've now replaced the localhost IP 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0

# Adobe-URL-Block-List
This is the Adobe URL/IP block list for the Hosts file,
Make sure you run your text editor as 'Administrator',
Just copy and paste the full list into your host file and save, this will then block all the URLs/IPs that Adobe uses,
If you have any extra URLs/IPs, give me a shout, and I'll add them to the list.

The location of the host file is C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
You may need to check your settings to show hidden files, Once there, then overwrite with the host file or add the full list to your host file.

If you have any other issues, please open an issue, and I'll reply as soon as possible.
